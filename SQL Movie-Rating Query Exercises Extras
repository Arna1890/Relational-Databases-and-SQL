Q1
Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

SELECT DISTINCT name
from Reviewer
inner join Rating on Reviewer.rid=Rating.rid
Group by name
HAVING mid=101

Q2
For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

SELECT DISTINCT name, title, stars
from Rating
inner join Reviewer on Rating.rid=Reviewer.rid
inner join Movie on Rating.mid=Movie.mid
Group by name
HAVING name=director

Q3
Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of 
the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".)

SELECT DISTINCT name
from Reviewer
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT title
from Movie
ORDER by name

Q4
Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson.

SELECT title
from Movie
where mid not IN (SELECT DISTINCT mid from Rating where rid = 205 ORDER by mid)
